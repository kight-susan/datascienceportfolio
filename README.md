# Data Science Portfolio - Susan Kight, M.S.

<p>Portfolio of data science projects completed by me in academic and pro bono settings, and presented in the form of iPython Jupyter Notebooks, R Markdown files, and non-technical business presentations.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p><strong>I redefine organizational competitiveness at the intersection of data, domain knowledge/strategy, and digital products to guide decision making and add business value.</strong></p>
<p>A fifteen-year diverse career evolving from <strong>data and analytics</strong>, marketing, business analysis, product management to project management, and recent graduate study from a <strong>top-ranked Data Science masters program</strong> has created a unique skill set that is my greatest strength. Known as a chief connector between business and technical teams who is a get-it-done guru, I strive on delivering business outcomes.</p>

<p>What excites me is data and analytics – it's my passion. Together with strong ambition as a data-driven problem solver and facination for data science, it has set a spark to use data in a way that transforms organizations to deliver real change and maximize value.</p>

<p>I thrive in cultures that embrace data and have a data-driven decision-making culture. This expands into the pro bono work that I do for a coalition of local food pantries offering data analytics services for which I’m on track to publish an IRB approved research study of my work on food insecurity.</p>

<p>The evolution in my career has been fueled by my curiosity, approach as a continuous learner, and innate data-driven intuition. It has enabled my career to develop towards data science as my skills have advanced. Using data and providing analytics, I add value across organizations supporting customer growth, market competitiveness, operational efficiencies and delivering business outcomes.</p>
